FILE DESCRIPTION:
Training set made of 2 subjects who had gone through 5 sessions, for a total of 60 Data_S*_Sess*.csv files. 60 feedbacks were provided in each session except the fifth one for which 100 feedbacks were provided.
Data_S*_Sess01.csv -> 60 feedbacks
Data_S*_Sess02.csv -> 60 feedbacks
Data_S*_Sess03.csv -> 60 feedbacks
Data_S*_Sess04.csv -> 60 feedbacks
Data_S*_Sess05.csv -> 100 feedbacks


DATA DESCRIPTION:
Subject’s brain activity was recorded with 56 passive EEG sensors whose placement followed the extended 10-20 system.
Eye movements are detected by EOG derivation.
